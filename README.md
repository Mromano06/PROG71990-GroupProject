Division of labour within the group:

Evan - Worked on the UI, display functions, search functions, add function, and most importantly, the Canadian flag 

Matt - Worked on the linked list and all its functions, created the product struct and its functions, file input, file output, delete function, and the update function

Liv - Created the project idea, debugged and fixed file io and other bits and bobs

=============================================================================================
When printing/downloading data to a file the file should be formatted as such:

Price
Sku
Quantity
Name
Description

Each part of the "PRODUCT" struct should be listed line by line,
any other formatting will result in data being disrupted or incorrect and could cause errors,
we can change this if necessary but this is just a heads up
- Matt Romano

file io doesnt like linked list or the other way around, it works but barely :(
