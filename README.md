When printing/download data to a file the file should be formatted as such:

Price
Sku
Quantity
Name
Desc

Each part of the "PRODUCT" struct should be listed line by line,
any other formatting will result in data being disrupted or incorrect and could cause errors,
we can change this if necessary but this is just a heads up.
